Ce projet a pour objectif la rédaction d'un mémoire d'Actuariat en LaTeX. Le mémoire est structuré en plusieurs petits fichiers LaTeX pour faciliter la gestion de la structure. Des scripts Python sont également inclus pour générer les figures utilisées dans le mémoire.

# Project Rules and Decisions

This document outlines the key decisions and conventions adopted for the `optimal_retrocession` project. Adhering to these rules ensures consistency, maintainability, and efficient collaboration.

## 1. Folder Structure

*   **`scripts/`**: Contains all Python scripts used for analysis, data processing, and result generation.
*   **`results/`**: Stores all output files generated by the scripts (e.g., plots, processed data, tables). This directory is explicitly ignored by Git.
*   **`memoire/`**: Dedicated to the LaTeX source files of the actuarial dissertation.
*   **`contexte.md`**: A Markdown file located at the project root, intended to hold the overarching context and objectives of the project, especially for LLM interactions.
*   **`memoire_complet.md`**: A generated Markdown file at the project root, containing the concatenated content of all LaTeX files. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive context for Large Language Models (LLMs) and is ignored by Git.

## 2. Development Environment

*   **Dependency Manager**: `uv` is the chosen dependency manager due to its speed and efficiency.
*   **Virtual Environment**: The project utilizes a virtual environment located in the `.venv/` directory (which is ignored by Git). This environment is managed by `uv`.
*   **Automatic Activation**: The virtual environment is automatically activated upon entering the project directory using `direnv`.
*   **`direnv` Configuration**: The `.envrc` file at the project root uses the `PATH_add .venv/bin` directive. This ensures that `direnv` integrates with the existing `uv`-managed virtual environment rather than attempting to create its own.

## 3. Automation and Workflows

*   **Automation Tool**: `make` is used to streamline and automate common development tasks.
*   **`make concat` Target**:
    *   **Action**: Executes the `scripts/concat_latex.py` script.
    *   **Input**: `memoire/main.tex` (the main LaTeX file).
    *   **Output**: `memoire_complet.md` at the project root.
    *   **Purpose**: To generate a single, comprehensive Markdown file of the dissertation content, primarily for LLM analysis.
*   **`make pdf` Target (Future)**: A target for compiling the LaTeX document into a PDF will be added to the `Makefile` once the LaTeX compilation process is confirmed to be functional.
