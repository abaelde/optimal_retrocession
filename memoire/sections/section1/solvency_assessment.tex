\section{How to shock the solvency ratio ?}

In previous section \ref{sec:SHOCK_BS} and \ref{sec:SHOCK_RC}, we demonstrated how to shock the capital and capital requirement of a legal entity. The final step consist in reuniting these two aspects in the assessment of shock effect on the company solvency. Considering the update capital $C^U$ and capital requirement vector $RC^U$, the updated solvency ratio is computed as:

\begin{equation}
    SR^U = \frac{C^U}{RC^U}
\end{equation}

We present results on several levels of approximation.

\subsection{Case with only capital shocked}

\begin{equation}
    SR^U = \frac{C^U}{RC^U} = \frac{C + \Delta C}{RC + \Delta RC} \approx \frac{C + \Delta C}{RC}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Case with capital and required capital shocked}

\begin{equation}
    SR^U = \frac{C^U}{RC^U} = \frac{C + \Delta C}{RC + \Delta RC}
\end{equation}
