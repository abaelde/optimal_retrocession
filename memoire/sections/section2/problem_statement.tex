\section{Problem Statement}

Goal: assuming a given "sinistre", what is the internal retrocession structure allows to optimize a given solvency criteria ?

The aim of this section is to provide an algorithm allowing to compute the optimal internal retrocession of a reinsurance group.


Entity : definition

variables of entity $i$ : capital, capital requirement, any other variable

risk tranfer mechanism between entities

function fij(parameters of the contract, entities internal variables



\section{Optimal Solvency criterion proposition }

The optimality criterion is the 

\begin{equation}
	Cost = \sum \frac{1}{SR^i - 1}
\end{equation}
or infinity if at least 1 SR is less than 1


theoretical results on risk transfers and cost associated with the distribution of risks in terms of required capital.
